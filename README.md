- **Inline Context**: View relevant recitals side-by-side with articles to better understand the legislative intent.
- **Definitions Context**: Automatically highlights defined terms (e.g., "online platform") and shows their legal definition on hover.
- **TF-IDF Analysis**: Uses transparent, client-side text analysis (TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity) to suggest relationships without external API calls.

### 🎨 Design & Accessibility
- **Dark Mode**: Fully supported dark theme that respects system settings.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for reading on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### 🖨️ Professional Export
- **Customizable Printing**: Create clean, print-ready documents or PDFs.

- **Inline Context in PDF**: Option to include "Related Recitals" directly next to articles in the printed output.

### 🌐 Browser Extension
- **Universal Support**: Open recent EU laws directly from EUR-Lex using the browser extension.
- **Direct Import Flow**: The extension sends the current EUR-Lex URL to LegalViz through the existing `/import?...` compatibility entrypoint.
- **Lightweight Design**: The extension does not capture or store full HTML pages locally.
- **Canonical Imports**: Once resolved, LegalViz redirects imported laws to clean canonical URLs like `/gdpr` or `/regulation-2018-1972`.

## How to Use

### Option 1: Use Pre-loaded Laws (No Extension Required)

Visit [LegalViz.EU](https://legalviz.eu) and select from the pre-loaded legal instruments:

- **AI Act** (EU 2024/1689)
- **GDPR** (EU 2016/679) – Unconsolidated
- **DMA** (EU 2022/1925) – Unconsolidated
- **DSA** (EU 2022/2065)
- **Data Act** (EU 2023/2854)
- **Data Governance Act** (EU 2022/868)

### Option 2: Visualize Any EU Law from EUR-Lex (Extension Required)

The visualiser can open **any EU law** (at least newer ones) directly from EUR-Lex. To use this feature, you need to install a browser extension.

#### Install the Browser Extension

[![Brave](https://img.shields.io/badge/Brave-FB542B?style=for-the-badge&logo=Brave&logoColor=white)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eur-lex-visualiser/akkfdjadggheloggnfonppfkbifanpbc)

[![Firefox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firefox-FF7139?style=for-the-badge&logo=Firefox-Browser&logoColor=white)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/eur-lex-visualiser/)

- **Chrome, Brave, or Edge**: [Install from Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eur-lex-visualiser/akkfdjadggheloggnfonppfkbifanpbc)
- **Firefox**: [Install from Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/eur-lex-visualiser/)

#### Using the Extension

1. Install the extension for your browser (see links above).
2. Visit any EU law page on [EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu) — for example, the [GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng).
3. On supported EUR-Lex text pages, the extension opens LegalViz and passes the current EUR-Lex URL for server-side resolution.
4. LegalViz resolves that URL to a CELEX identifier, fetches the corresponding Formex document, and redirects to the canonical law URL for the act.

> 💡 **Note:** LegalViz now uses a Formex-only import flow. If you still have an older extension version installed, update it before importing laws from EUR-Lex.

## Browser Support

The application works in most modern browsers:
- Chrome, Brave, Edge (Chromium-based browsers)
- Firefox
- Other modern browsers with ES6+ JavaScript support

## For Developers

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

#### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maastrichtlawtech/eur-lex-visualiser.git
cd eu-law-visualiser
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Development Commands

- `npm run dev` – Start the development server with hot module replacement
- `npm run build` – Build the project for production
- `npm run preview` – Preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` – Run ESLint to check code quality

### Adding Laws

LegalViz now loads laws through CELEX/Formex-backed routes and stored metadata rather than a bundled pre-loaded list. Import or open a law by CELEX, official reference, or EUR-Lex URL and the app will persist its metadata locally for later reuse.

### Tech Stack

- **React** – UI framework
- **Vite** – Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** – Styling
- **Framer Motion** – Animations
- **Lucide React** – Icons

### How It Works

1. **Parsing**: The application fetches Formex XML for CELEX-backed EU laws and parses that structure into Articles, Chapters, Sections, Recitals, and Annexes.
2. **Indexing**: A client-side inverted index is built on the fly to enable instant full-text search.
3. **Analysis**: The `nlp.js` module computes TF-IDF vectors for all articles and recitals to find semantic similarities, linking recitals to relevant articles automatically.
4. **State Management**: The selected law and current view are synchronized with the URL, allowing for bookmarkable links and browser back/forward navigation.
5. **Extension Integration**: The browser extension detects supported EUR-Lex pages and opens LegalViz with the current EUR-Lex `sourceUrl`.
6. **URL Resolution**: The backend resolves the EUR-Lex URL to a canonical CELEX identifier, and the app redirects from `/import?...` to the canonical public law URL.
